Education SGP and Proficiency Lab: Analyzed the relationship between SGP (student growth percentile) and Proficiency, with practice pulling from specific parameters: SGP >=                                      66, spring window testing for Proficiency, proficiency levels 1 and 2 only; Ran a Spearman correlation test, cross tabulation, and                                             developed a Power BI dashboard to report in depth on the results.

Capstone 1: predicts the likelihood of Fullfillment based on literacy rates, recorded across  countries, using a regression analysis. The data was collected from                          Kaggle and World Health Organization's database. This project showcases my ability to perform an insightful regressional analysis on a topic 
            that reaches into my social science interests. 

Capstone 2: showcases how I scraped data on almost all cat cafes from all over the world (if not all, just 92). I coded various successful scrapers to create my 
            database from scratch, then used the ratings of each cafe to predict what baseline admissions price would be the most accessible or even acceptable, in a
            financial sense. I tested different prediction models to determine which price tier was likely to result in a successful cafe (deemed if the cafe was rated 4.2 or              higher).

Capstone 3:  I engineered and analyzed visual features (non/carousel post, whitespace-to-text ratios, and number of faces) of Instagram infographic screenshots to uncover                  patterns linked to higher engagement. The visual elements were identified using TesserAct. I meant to demonstrate my ability tocreate exploratory modeling using               image classification and engagement metrics (like count, comment count, like-to-comment ratio)
