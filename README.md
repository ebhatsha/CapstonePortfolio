Capstone 1: predicts the likelihood of Fullfillment based on literacy rates, recorded across  countries, using a regression analysis. The data was collected from Kaggle
            and World Health Organization's database. This project showcases my ability to perform an insightful regressional analysis on a topic that reaches into my 
            social science interests. 
Capstone 2: showcases how I scraped data on almost all cat cafes from all over the world (if not all, just 92). I coded various successful scrapers to create my 
            database from scratch, then used the ratings of each cafe to predict what baseline admissions price would be the most accessible or even acceptable, in a
            financial sense. I tested different prediction models to determine which price tier was likely to result in a successful cafe (deemed if the cafe was rated
            4.2 or higher).
